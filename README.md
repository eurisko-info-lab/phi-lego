# phi-lego

## Overview

**Phi** is the platform, **Lego** its language for both humans (as last) and machines (as first).

## Philosophy

### Phi: The Platform
Phi serves as the foundational platform that provides the infrastructure and environment for computation and interaction.

### Lego: The Language
Lego is designed as a language with a unique philosophy:
- **Machine-First**: Optimized for machine readability and processing as the primary concern
- **Human-Last**: Human readability follows, ensuring machines can efficiently interpret and execute before human comprehension is considered

This approach inverts the traditional programming paradigm, prioritizing computational efficiency and machine understanding while maintaining eventual human accessibility.

## Vision

The phi-lego project aims to create a harmonious ecosystem where:
- The **Phi platform** provides robust, scalable infrastructure
- The **Lego language** enables precise, machine-optimized communication
- Machines process efficiently while humans can still understand and interact with the system
